		I then cd into my project and create a branch with 'git checkout -b heather-beckman'

		At this point, I want to make sure that the branch was added successfully.
		
		I add new files to my project by using 'touch "file name"' and 'git add "file-name"'

		Now, I am set up to work on my project and add, commit, and check status often.

		Next, I will have to push my completed project to GitHub by using the command 'git push'

		Finally, I will open a pull request on my branch on GitHub and add my TL as a reviewer for the pull request.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

		An inline element will appear on only one line.  A block element can wrap and take up several lines.  Span is an inline element and div is a block element.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

		When an element is positioned absolutely it is no longer positioned relative to the entire page, but to the closest element which is positioned to the page. This means that margins and padding will be based on the distance from this closest element.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

		Set the desired width, and make sure that margin and padding is set to 0px so it doesn't take up anymore space.

    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

		3 block elements are <div>, <p>, and <section>, 2 inline elements are <span> and <a>.  An element that is inline-block is the the <button> element.

5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 

		The box model means that everything in an HTML document is surounded by a box that includes the element itself, padding, border, and margin.  The problem we can have with this model is that each of these elements take up space and it makes it diffuclt to caculate where everything will be positioned on the page because of this. One thing you can do to "fix" this is to make sure you calculate the size of an element including all of the items (margin, padding, border, and object size). An easier way to deal with this problem would be to use flexbox.
